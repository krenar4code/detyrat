        <p>Did someone say “Fresh-baked, gluten-free bread?”</p>
        <p>
            When it comes to gluten-free options, you know we’ve got your back fam. From
            <a href="#">delicious cookies</a> to <a href="#">decadent brownies</a> and <a href="#">flavorful pizzas</a>,
            we’re dedicated to making all of our products and recipes more inclusive of all dietary restrictions. It was
            only a matter of time until we whipped up a gluten-free (vegan and allergy-friendly) bread recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Made with our <a href="#">Pizza Crust Baking Mix</a>, this gluten-free bread recipe is almost as easy
            as 1-2-3. Bake a loaf, or two, and use it throughout the week to make sandwiches, avocado toast, or even
            mixed with some herbs and spices to make breadcrumbs. Shop our Pizza Crust Baking Mix on
            <a href="#">partakefoods.com</a>, and don’t forget to <a href="#">try more recipes</a> using our versatile mix.

        <h1>Gluten-Free Bread</h1>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> One box Partake Pizza Crust Mix makes one small-sized loaf.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Packet (7g) yeast</li>
            <li>1 T Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>1-1/4 C Water, warm (less than 105°F)</li>
            <li>3 T Ground Flaxseed</li>
            <li>¼ t sea salt (optional)</li>
            <li>1 t sugar (optional)</li>
            <li>1 Package Partake Pizza Crust Mix</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine yeast, apple cider vinegar, water, flaxseed, optional salt, and sugar in a bowl or mixer. Allow flax to hydrate for about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Add Partake Pizza Crust Mix to wet ingredients, mix for about 2 minutes until shiny. Dough will be sticky and wet, not like conventional bread.</li>
            <li>Pour dough into an oiled, sprayed, or non-stick bread pan.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (375°F convection).</li>
            <li>While the oven is heating, cover the bread pan, and allow it to rise in a warm place for about 20-30 minutes (or longer, if desired).</li>
            <li>Place the pan into the oven, and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle reads 190-200°F.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and loaf pan and cool on a rack.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">Note: Bread is easiest to handle and slice once it has sat out for 24 hours, at a minimum overnight.</p>
