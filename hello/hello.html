                <p>Recently I started exploring some new typography layouts and bespoke fonts from VJ Type. I thought visualizing some of the motivational quotes I’ve been collecting looked like a good place to begin. I've done a few variants below and will add more as I find them.</p>

                <h2>Graphic Design Showcase</h2>
                <p>Create a great impression with this minimal typographic design. Add your name and details with Adobe InDesign and you are set to go. All the fonts are included free, you’ll just need to install them. The design is set up to print online on moo.com or any other friendly printer. Make sure you send a picture of the finished result.</p>
